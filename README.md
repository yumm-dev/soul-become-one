# Installation
In your OpenKH Mod Manager window, press Insert or the green plus button and type in yumm-dev/soul-become-one. The installation will be done for you.

Once installed, make sure the box to the left of it is checked to enable it. Keep this mod above any mods that mess with the text read on TBCO's name, description, or stats.

If you are playing KH2FM Rando and your seed contains randomized keyblade stats and you want it to apply to Soul Eater still, place the mod below your randomizer seed.

If your seed does not contain randomized keyblade stats and/or you want Soul Eater's custom stats to override the seed, place this above your randomizer seed.
